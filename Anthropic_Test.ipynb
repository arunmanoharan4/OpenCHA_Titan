      "Final Answer: Based on the sleep data analysis for patient 5 during August 2020, the average REM sleep duration is 97.5 minutes per night. For adults, the recommended REM sleep duration is typically 20-25% of total sleep time. In this case, with an average total sleep time of 425 minutes, the REM sleep makes up about 23% of total sleep time (97.5/425 = 0.23 or 23%). This falls within the healthy range for REM sleep, indicating that patient 5's REM sleep during August 2020 was sufficient. The sleep efficiency is also very good at 94.5%, suggesting overall healthy sleep patterns.\n"
